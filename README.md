# MyJavaProjectWorkshop

This repository contains a collection of Java programs and small projects created as part of my ongoing practice and reinforcement of core Java skills. Each program is organized into proper packages and developed using IntelliJ IDEA, reflecting real-world development practices.

## üìå About This Project

While I have already built a strong foundation in Java and have listed it as a core skill on my resume, this workshop-style project helps me maintain fluency in Java syntax, OOP concepts, and standard libraries.

This repository is a reflection of:
- Clean Java coding practices
- Real IDE structure (IntelliJ, with package declarations)
- Regular hands-on reinforcement of Java concepts

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Java SE
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Git & GitHub

## üß† Concepts Practiced

- Basic concepts of Java- looping, methods, operators, conditional statememts
- Object-Oriented Programming (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction)
- Java Collections Framework (List, Map, Set)
- Exception Handling
- File I/O
- Basic Algorithmic Problems
- Utility and Helper Classes

## üìÅ Project Structure

Each Java class is part of a structured package, created and maintained via IntelliJ IDEA.
